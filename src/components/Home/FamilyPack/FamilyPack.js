            Tandoori Fusion brings in a rotating roster of chefs that have been classically trained in both southern and northern Indian
            recipes. These chefs have been trained all over the world, and we're lucky enough to have them as a part of the story that is
            Tandoori Fusion. The faces may change, but the quality of our dishes certainly doesn't!
